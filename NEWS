# 2015.3.29

Removed the documentation generation aspect (apart from the actual docs embedded in the specs)
from this repository in order to get a better separation of concerns. The documentation is created
by makedoc.py in the [freesmartphone.github.io](https://github.com/freesmartphone/freesmartphone.github.io)
repository.
